---

## Bugs Found and Fixed

### Bug #1: Ball Boundary Collision
**Issue**: Ball bouncing at margin=20px prevented reaching goal zones at x:10/x:790

**Root Cause**: Boundary check applied to all X positions regardless of Y coordinate

**Fix**: Modified boundary logic to exclude goal zones
```typescript
// Before (broken):
if (this.ball.x <= margin || this.ball.x >= this.scale.width - margin) {
  this.ballVelocity.x *= -0.8
  this.ball.x = Phaser.Math.Clamp(this.ball.x, margin, this.scale.width - margin)
}

// After (fixed):
if (this.ball.x <= margin && (this.ball.y < this.leftGoal.yMin || this.ball.y > this.leftGoal.yMax)) {
  this.ballVelocity.x *= -0.8
  this.ball.x = margin
}
```

**Location**: `GameScene.ts:325-342`
**Status**: ✅ Fixed and verified

### Bug #2: Particle Texture Generation
**Issue**: `particle.generateTexture is not a function`

**Root Cause**: Attempted to call method on GameObjects.Circle (doesn't have this method)

**Fix**: Used GameObjects.Graphics instead
```typescript
// Before (broken):
const particle = this.add.circle(0, 0, 4, 0xffffff)
particle.generateTexture('spark', 8, 8) // ❌

// After (fixed):
const graphics = this.add.graphics()
graphics.fillStyle(0xffffff, 1)
graphics.fillCircle(4, 4, 4)
graphics.generateTexture('spark', 8, 8) // ✅
```

**Location**: `GameScene.ts:432-439`
**Status**: ✅ Fixed and verified

## What Was Deferred

### Sound Effects (Low Priority)
**Reason**: Requires external audio assets

**What's Needed**:
- kick.mp3 (ball kick sound)
- goal.mp3 (celebration horn/cheering)
- whistle.mp3 (match start/end)

**Implementation Plan**: Can be added later with minimal code changes
**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours (including asset sourcing)

### Pass Mechanic (Medium Priority)
**Reason**: Requires AI teammates (Week 7-8)

**Deferred To**: Week 7-8 AI implementation

### Ball Curve/Spin (Low Priority)
**Reason**: Optional enhancement, not critical for MVP

**Deferred To**: Post-MVP enhancements
