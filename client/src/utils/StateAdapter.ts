/**
 * State Adapter
 *
 * Provides a unified interface for accessing game state from different sources.
 * Normalizes state structures between GameEngine (SinglePlayer/AIOnly) and
 * NetworkManager (Multiplayer) to eliminate duplication and simplify scene code.
 *
 * @example Basic usage
 * ```typescript
 * // In SinglePlayerScene
 * protected getUnifiedState() {
 *   return StateAdapter.fromGameEngine(this.gameEngine.getState())
 * }
 *
 * // In GameScene
 * protected getUnifiedState() {
 *   const state = this.networkManager?.getState()
 *   return state ? StateAdapter.fromNetwork(state) : null
 * }
 *
 * // Common usage in BaseGameScene
 * const unified = this.getUnifiedState()
 * const myTeam = StateAdapter.getPlayerTeam(unified, this.myPlayerId)
 * const teammates = StateAdapter.getTeammateIds(unified, this.myPlayerId)
 * ```
