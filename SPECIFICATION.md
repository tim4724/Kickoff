# Socca2 - Arcade Soccer Game
## Technical Specification v1.0

**Project Type:** Fast-paced multiplayer arcade soccer for mobile web
**Strategy:** Agile MVP ‚Üí Iterative enhancement
**Timeline:** 3-4 months to production-ready MVP

---

## üéØ Core Vision

**Elevator Pitch:** Fast-paced 5v5 arcade soccer where you control the player nearest to the ball, competing against another human player in 2-4 minute matches. Think "FIFA Street meets mobile web gaming."

**Key Differentiators:**
- Real-time 1v1 multiplayer (each controlling 5-player teams)
- Cursor-switching control (auto-switch to nearest player to ball)
- Arcade physics (no simulation complexity)
- Mobile-first web deployment (PWA)
- 2-4 minute match duration (perfect for mobile sessions)

---

## üéÆ Gameplay Mechanics

### Control Scheme
**Input System:**
- **Virtual Joystick** (left thumb): Movement control
- **Action Button** (right thumb): Context-sensitive pass/shoot
  - Near goal ‚Üí shoot
  - Away from goal ‚Üí pass to nearest teammate
  - Hold duration ‚Üí power modifier

**Player Switching:**
- **Automatic cursor switching** to player closest to ball
- Visual indicator shows controlled player (highlight/arrow)
- Smooth transitions between players during play
- Ball possession = control locked to that player

### Match Structure
- **Format:** 1 human + 4 AI bots vs 1 human + 4 AI bots
- **Duration:** 2-4 minutes per match
- **Camera:** Top-down orthographic view
- **Field:** Simplified soccer pitch (single screen or scrolling TBD)
- **Scoring:** Traditional goals, tiebreaker by sudden death or penalties

### AI Teammate Behavior
**Critical Success Factor:** AI must feel competent, not frustrating

**AI Responsibilities:**
- **Positioning:** Formation-based (4-4-2 or 4-3-3 simple formations)
- **Movement:** Run to open space, track opposing players
- **Actions:** Automatic pass reception, basic interceptions
- **Difficulty:** Adaptive - mirror opponent AI skill to maintain balance

**AI System Architecture:**
- Rule-based state machine (not ML for MVP)
- States: Attacking, Defending, Supporting, Chasing ball
- Pathfinding: Simple waypoint navigation (A* if needed, likely simpler)

### Ball Mechanics
**Arcade Physics Approach:**
- Ball "magnetism" to players when close (forgiving arcade feel)
- Simplified trajectories (linear interpolation with arc modifier)
- Pass speed: Fixed or distance-based
- Shot power: Button hold duration (0.1s - 1.5s charge)
- No spin, curve, or advanced physics

**Possession Rules:**
- Ball sticks to player slightly (arcade style)
- Tackles = proximity-based (touch opponent with ball ‚Üí contest)
- Loose ball = both teams can claim (closest player wins)

---

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack

**Rendering Engine:** [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/)
- **Why:** Best-in-class 2D web game framework
- Mature, well-documented, active community
- WebGL + Canvas fallback for compatibility
- Built-in sprite management, animations, input handling
- Mobile-optimized touch controls
- Free and MIT licensed

**Graphics Approach:** 2D sprite-based (Phase 1)
- Top-down player sprites (4-8 directional animations)
- Simple ball sprite with shadow
- Field background (single image or tiled)
- UI overlays (score, timer, controls)
- **Art style:** Low-poly flat design or pixel art (asset-friendly)

**3D Alternative (Phase 2+):** Three.js or Babylon.js
- Simple 3D models (low-poly characters)
- Top-down camera maintained
- Higher fidelity but slower development

**Client Framework:** TypeScript + Vite
- Modern build tooling for fast iteration
- Type safety for multiplayer state management
- Hot module replacement for development

### Backend Stack

**Multiplayer Server:** [Colyseus](https://colyseus.io/)
- **Why:** Purpose-built for real-time web multiplayer games
- Room-based architecture (perfect for matches)
- State synchronization built-in (delta compression)
- WebSocket transport with fallback support
- TypeScript support (shared types with frontend)
- Automatic matchmaking capabilities
- Free and MIT licensed

**Alternative:** Custom Node.js + Socket.IO
- More flexible but requires building state sync from scratch
- **Recommendation:** Use Colyseus - faster MVP delivery

**Server Features Needed:**
- Match rooms (10-player capacity per room)
- Game state authority (validate all actions server-side)
- Client-side prediction reconciliation
- Player authentication (JWT tokens)
- Matchmaking queue (simple pairing system)

**Database:** PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM
- User accounts (username, password hash, stats)
- Match history (optional for MVP)
- Leaderboards (wins, goals, rankings)
- Can use Supabase for managed Postgres + auth

**Hosting Options:**

| Service | Use Case | Cost (Est) |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Railway/Render** | MVP/Testing | $20-50/mo |
| **AWS/GCP** | Production scaling | $50-200/mo |
| **Hathora/Edgegap** | Optimized game hosting | $100-300/mo |

**MVP Recommendation:** Railway or Render for simplicity

### Network Architecture

**Communication Protocol:** WebSocket (via Colyseus)
- Binary state snapshots for efficiency
- Target tick rate: 20-30 updates/second
- Client prediction for local player movement
- Server reconciliation for authoritative state

**State Synchronization Strategy:**

```
Client Input ‚Üí Server Validates ‚Üí Broadcast State ‚Üí Client Interpolates
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì                    ‚Üì                  ‚Üì
  Predict      Simulate Game        Delta Update      Smooth Render
```

**Data Flow (per frame):**
1. **Client ‚Üí Server:** Player input (joystick vector, button state)
2. **Server ‚Üí Clients:** Game state snapshot (10 player positions, ball state, score)
3. **Client Processing:** Interpolate between snapshots for smooth visuals
4. **Prediction:** Client immediately moves local player, waits for server confirmation

**Latency Handling:**
- Client-side prediction (no input lag for local player)
- Lag compensation (server rewinds time for hit detection)
- Interpolation buffer (100-150ms of state history)
- Visual smoothing (lerp between positions)

**Network Performance Targets:**
- Latency: <100ms playable, <50ms ideal
- Bandwidth: ~5-10 KB/s per client (compressed state)
- Packet loss: Handle up to 5% gracefully

---

## üì± Mobile Deployment

### Progressive Web App (PWA)

**Why PWA for MVP:**
- No app store approval delays
- Instant updates without resubmission
- Cross-platform (iOS/Android) from single codebase
- Users can "install" to home screen
- Service workers for offline-capable assets

**Mobile Optimizations:**
- Touch-optimized virtual joystick (thumb-friendly zones)
- Responsive layout (portrait or landscape support)
- Battery optimization (throttle rendering when inactive)
- Reduced asset sizes (sprite atlases, compressed textures)
- Adaptive quality settings (detect device performance)

**PWA Requirements:**
- HTTPS hosting (required for service workers)
- Web manifest file (icon, name, theme)
- Service worker for caching
- Responsive viewport meta tags

**Post-MVP Path:** Capacitor wrapper
- If app store presence needed, wrap PWA in native container
- Access native APIs (haptics, notifications)
- Minimal code changes required

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas

**1. AI Teammate Quality** üî¥ **CRITICAL**
- **Risk:** Bad AI ruins gameplay experience
- **Impact:** Players feel frustrated by own teammates
- **Mitigation:**
  - Allocate 2-3 weeks for AI tuning specifically
  - Playtesting with focus on "does AI feel competent?"
  - Simple > Complex (rule-based beats broken ML)
  - Copy proven patterns (FIFA/Rocket League AI behaviors)

**2. Network Performance** üü° **IMPORTANT**
- **Risk:** Laggy multiplayer = unplayable
- **Impact:** Game feels unresponsive, unfair
- **Mitigation:**
  - Target 20 tick rate minimum (industry standard for web games)
  - Implement client-side prediction early
  - Test on real mobile networks (not just WiFi)
  - Regional servers if needed (start single region for MVP)

**3. Cursor Switching Confusion** üü° **IMPORTANT**
- **Risk:** Players lose track of which character they control
- **Impact:** Frustrating control feel, "I didn't press that!"
- **Mitigation:**
  - Strong visual feedback (highlight, arrow, color change)
  - Brief "lock" period after switch (prevent rapid switching)
  - Playtesting to tune switching sensitivity
  - Tutorial mode to explain mechanic

### Medium-Risk Areas

**4. Mobile Performance** üü¢ **MODERATE**
- **Risk:** Low-end devices struggle with rendering + networking
- **Impact:** Limited audience reach
- **Mitigation:**
  - Target 30 FPS minimum on mid-range devices (iPhone 11, Pixel 4a)
  - Adaptive quality settings (reduce sprites/effects on slow devices)
  - Phaser's WebGL rendering is well-optimized
  - Profile early and often

**5. Matchmaking Time** üü¢ **MODERATE**
- **Risk:** Not enough players = long wait times
- **Impact:** Players quit before finding match
- **Mitigation:**
  - Bots as fallback (play vs AI if no human opponent)
  - Show estimated wait time
  - Post-launch: viral mechanics for player growth

**6. Scope Creep** üü¢ **MODERATE**
- **Risk:** Feature additions delay MVP
- **Impact:** Never ship, or ship late with bugs
- **Mitigation:**
  - **Strict MVP scope enforcement** (this document as contract)
  - Phase 2 features are explicitly deferred
  - Weekly review: "Does this block MVP shipping?"
