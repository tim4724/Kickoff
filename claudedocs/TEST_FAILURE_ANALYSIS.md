# Test Failure Analysis - Ball Capture Tests

**Date:** 2025-10-02
**Status:** ⚠️ Tests Fixed (Partial) - Movement Simulation Limitations

## Problem Summary

Running `npm run test:e2e` resulted in failures for all ball-capture tests (5 tests) due to outdated test patterns and fundamental limitations in automated multiplayer game testing.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. ✅ FIXED: Outdated Test Pattern
**Issue:** Tests expected a "Multiplayer" button that no longer exists
**Why:** Game architecture changed to auto-connect on load (GameScene.ts:96)
**Fix:** Removed all `button:has-text("Multiplayer").click()` patterns

### 2. ✅ FIXED: Missing Multiplayer Setup
**Issue:** Tests ran with single client instead of 2-client multiplayer setup
**Why:** Tests didn't use beforeAll/afterAll pattern from multiplayer-e2e.spec.ts
**Fix:** Added proper 2-client browser context setup with beforeAll/afterAll

### 3. ✅ FIXED: Wrong Test API
**Issue:** Tests called `controls.test.setJoystick()` which doesn't exist
**Why:** Incorrect assumption about test API
**Fix:** Updated to use actual API: `touchJoystick()` → `dragJoystick()` → `releaseJoystick()`

### 4. ⚠️ LIMITATION: Movement Simulation Unreliable
**Issue:** Joystick simulation doesn't reliably move players to capture ball
**Why:** Complex multiplayer physics + network sync difficult to automate
**Result:** Ball remains uncaptured (possessed by: none) in all tests

## Test Results

### Before Fix
```
❌ All 5 tests timeout (30s each)
Error: Waiting for button:has-text("Multiplayer")
```

### After Fix
```
✅ 2 passed (observational tests with no assertions)
⚠️ 2 skipped (ball not captured, can't test pressure)
❌ 1 failed (Test 4: expects ball possession but gets none)
```

## Files Modified

1. `/Users/tim/Projects/Socca2/tests/ball-capture.spec.ts`
   - Added 2-client multiplayer setup (beforeAll/afterAll)
   - Removed Multiplayer button clicks
   - Fixed test API calls (setJoystick → touchJoystick/dragJoystick/releaseJoystick)
   - Added player movement simulation before pressure tests

## Recommended Actions

### Short Term: Skip Automated Runs
```typescript
// Mark as manual E2E test
test.describe.skip('Ball Capture - Proximity Pressure', () => {
  // Tests require manual verification
})
```

### Medium Term: Simplify Tests
Test ball capture logic at unit/integration level:
```typescript
// Test server-side ball capture logic directly
test('Ball capture pressure calculation', () => {
  const gameState = new GameState()
  // Test pressure logic without full game simulation
})
```

### Long Term: Better Test Strategy
1. **Unit tests**: Server-side ball capture logic
2. **Integration tests**: Ball capture with mocked network
3. **Manual E2E**: Visual verification of multiplayer mechanics
4. **Automated E2E**: Only for basic rendering/connection (like core-features-regression)

## Core Regression Tests Status

✅ **All 12 core regression tests passing** (36.4s)
- These tests work because they test basic rendering and state
- They don't require complex movement simulation
- Should remain as the primary automated test suite

## Conclusion

Ball-capture tests revealed:
1. ✅ **Fixed architectural drift**: Tests updated to match current game architecture
2. ⚠️ **Identified limitation**: Multiplayer game mechanics are difficult to automate
3. ✅ **Core tests stable**: Basic functionality regression testing works well

**Next Steps:**
- Mark ball-capture tests as manual/skip in CI
- Create unit tests for ball capture logic
- Keep core-features-regression as primary automated suite
