# Test Failure Analysis

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-02
**Status:** ✅ All Tests Passing

## Recent Fixes (October 2, 2025)

### Shooting Mechanics Test Failures (4 tests)

**Tests Fixed:**
1. `multiplayer-e2e.spec.ts:268` - Ball Magnetism Testing
2. `shooting-mechanics.spec.ts:175` - Basic shooting when in possession
3. `shooting-mechanics.spec.ts:310` - Shoot power variation
4. `shooting-mechanics.spec.ts:379` - Multiplayer shooting synchronization

#### Issue 1: Ball Magnetism Test
**Problem:** Test tried to access `scene.possessionIndicator.alpha`, but this property doesn't exist in GameScene

**Fix:** Updated test to check ball possession via server state:
```typescript
const state = scene.networkManager.getState()
return state.ball.possessedBy === mySessionId
```

**Files Modified:** `tests/multiplayer-e2e.spec.ts` (lines 289-299, 307-313)

#### Issue 2-4: Player State Persistence
**Problem:** Player's 'kicking' state was immediately overwritten by next input processing, causing all shooting tests to fail when checking player state

**Fix:** Added 300ms timer to persist 'kicking' state:
- Added `kickingUntil: number` property to Player schema
- Set timer when shooting: `player.kickingUntil = Date.now() + 300`
- Check timer in `processInputs()` to prevent state changes during animation

**Files Modified:** `server/src/schema/GameState.ts` (lines 32, 145-161, 432)

**Result:** All 4 shooting tests now pass reliably

## Ball Capture Tests - Previously Fixed

### Problem Summary
Running `npm run test:e2e` resulted in failures for all ball-capture tests (5 tests) due to outdated test patterns and fundamental limitations in automated multiplayer game testing.

### Root Causes Identified

#### 1. ✅ FIXED: Outdated Test Pattern
**Issue:** Tests expected a "Multiplayer" button that no longer exists
**Fix:** Removed all `button:has-text("Multiplayer").click()` patterns

#### 2. ✅ FIXED: Missing Multiplayer Setup
**Issue:** Tests ran with single client instead of 2-client multiplayer setup
**Fix:** Added proper 2-client browser context setup with beforeAll/afterAll

#### 3. ✅ FIXED: Wrong Test API
**Issue:** Tests called `controls.test.setJoystick()` which doesn't exist
**Fix:** Updated to use actual API: `touchJoystick()` → `dragJoystick()` → `releaseJoystick()`

#### 4. ✅ FIXED: Movement Speed and Buffer
**Issue:** Conservative movement calculation didn't ensure players reached target positions
**Fix:** Adjusted to 400 px/s effective speed with 2.0x buffer

#### 5. ✅ FIXED: Opponent Movement for Pressure
**Issue:** Tests checked pressure but opponent never moved close enough
**Fix:** Added opponent movement step with new helper function

## Current Test Status

### All Test Suites Passing
```
✅ Ball Capture Tests (5/5) - 38.6s
✅ Shooting Mechanics Tests (7/7) - ~45s
✅ Multiplayer E2E Tests (9/9) - ~60s
✅ Core Regression Tests (12/12) - 36.4s
```

### Test Coverage
- **Ball possession mechanics** - Proximity capture, pressure system, lockouts
- **Shooting mechanics** - Direction, power, multiplayer sync
- **Multiplayer sync** - Position, ball state, player colors
- **Core gameplay** - Movement, rendering, timer, scoring

## Test Architecture

### Framework
- **Playwright** for browser automation
- **Multiple browser contexts** for multiplayer simulation
- **Custom helper functions** for game-specific operations

### Key Helpers
```typescript
getBallState(page)          // Get ball position, velocity, possession
getPlayerState(page)        // Get player position, direction, team
gainPossession(page)        // Move player to capture ball
shootBall(page)             // Trigger shoot action
movePlayerTowardOpponent()  // Simulate opponent pressure
```

### Test Patterns
1. **Setup** - Connect clients, wait for game load
2. **State Verification** - Check initial state via server
3. **Action Simulation** - Use test API to trigger game actions
4. **Assertion** - Verify expected state changes
5. **Screenshots** - Capture visual evidence

## Running Tests

```bash
npm run test:e2e           # Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e:ui        # Run with Playwright UI
npm run clean:test         # Clean test artifacts
```

## Debugging Failed Tests

1. **Check Screenshots** - `test-results/` directory
2. **Console Logs** - Tests output detailed state information
3. **Playwright Trace** - Use `--trace on` flag
4. **Server Logs** - Check server console for errors

## Future Improvements

### Recommended
1. **Unit Tests** - Test server-side logic in isolation
2. **Integration Tests** - Mock network for faster feedback
3. **Visual Regression** - Automated screenshot comparison
4. **Performance Tests** - Measure and track frame rates

### Not Recommended
- Complex movement simulation (unreliable in E2E)
- Timing-sensitive assertions (network latency varies)
- Pixel-perfect position checks (reconciliation causes drift)
