# Socca2 Multiplayer Test Summary

**Date**: October 1, 2025
**Status**: ❌ **1 CRITICAL BUG FOUND**

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL BUG: Team Assignment Failure

### Issue
Both players are assigned to **BLUE team** instead of one BLUE and one RED.

### Impact
**Game is UNPLAYABLE** - players cannot distinguish teams

### Evidence
```javascript
// Expected:
Client 1: BLUE local + RED remote
Client 2: RED local + BLUE remote

// Actual:
Client 1: BLUE local + BLUE remote ❌
Client 2: BLUE local + RED remote ❌
```

### Root Cause
Race condition in `GameScene.updateLocalPlayerColor()` - called before player exists in server state.

```typescript
// Current implementation (BUGGY):
this.updateLocalPlayerColor()  // Called too early at line 660
// Player not in state yet → returns early → color never updated
```

### Fix (15 minutes)
**Option 2: Event-Based Update** (RECOMMENDED)

Add color update logic to existing `stateChange` event listener:

```typescript
private setupNetworkListeners() {
  this.networkManager.on('stateChange', (state: any) => {
    // NEW: Update color when player appears in state
    if (this.mySessionId && state.players?.has(this.mySessionId)) {
      const localPlayer = state.players.get(this.mySessionId)
      const expectedColor = localPlayer.team === 'blue' ? 0x0066ff : 0xff4444

      if (this.playerTeamColor !== expectedColor) {
        this.playerTeamColor = expectedColor
        this.player.setFillStyle(this.playerTeamColor)
        console.log(`✅ Color updated to ${localPlayer.team}`)
      }
    }

    this.updateFromServerState(state)
  })
}

// Remove premature call from connectToMultiplayer():
// this.updateLocalPlayerColor()  // ❌ DELETE THIS LINE
```

### Verification
1. Apply fix
2. Run: `npm run test:e2e`
3. Verify: Test 3 (Player Color Verification) passes
4. Manual test: Open two browser windows, confirm opposite team colors

## ✅ What's Working

| Feature | Status | Evidence |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Server connectivity | ✅ PASS | Both clients connect to ws://localhost:3000 |
| Session management | ✅ PASS | Unique session IDs assigned (o5ELUwdJH, ALjrrLr4a) |
| Remote player creation | ✅ PASS | Each client sees the other player |
| Ball position sync | ✅ PASS | Ball position updates on both clients |
| Match start | ✅ PASS | Both clients receive match_start event |
| State updates | ✅ PASS | Score and timer sync across clients |

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Playwright + Phaser Incompatibility
- **Keyboard input does NOT work** via Playwright automation
- **Game controls API returns null** (page context isolation)
- **Manual browser testing required** for keyboard-based features

### Manual Test Checklist
1. Open two browser windows at http://localhost:5173
2. ✅ Verify player colors (BLUE vs RED)
3. ✅ Test keyboard movement (Arrow keys)
4. ✅ Test ball shooting (Space key)
5. ✅ Verify position synchronization
6. ✅ Test goal scoring

## 📁 Files

**Full Report**: `claudedocs/MULTIPLAYER_E2E_TEST_REPORT.md`
**Test Suite**: `tests/multiplayer-e2e.spec.ts`
**Test Config**: `playwright.config.ts`

**Code to Fix**:
