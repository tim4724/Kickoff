## Feature Test Results

### 1. Goal Zone Detection ✅ PASS

**Test Method**: Directly placed ball inside goal zones and verified detection

**Left Goal (Red Team Scores)**:
- **Goal Zone**: x: 10, width: 20 (extends to x: 30)
- **Y Range**: height/2 ± 60px (240-360px at 600px height)
- **Test Result**: ✅ Ball at x:15, y:300 → Detected correctly
- **Score Update**: 0-0 → 0-1 (Red team)

**Right Goal (Blue Team Scores)**:
- **Goal Zone**: x: width-10, width: 20
- **Y Range**: height/2 ± 60px
- **Test Result**: ✅ Ball at x:785, y:300 → Detected correctly
- **Score Update**: 0-1 → 1-1 (Blue team)

**Edge Cases Tested**:
- ✅ Ball outside Y range → No goal (correct)
- ✅ Ball approaching with velocity → Bounces (expected with current boundary logic)
- ✅ Ball inside zone at rest → Goal triggered immediately

**Code Reference**: `GameScene.ts:355-380` (checkGoal method)

---

### 2. Scoring System ✅ PASS

**Test Method**: Triggered goals for both teams and verified score display updates

**Initial State**:
- Score Display: "0 - 0"
- Position: Center top of screen (x: 400, y: 30)
- Font: 32px, white, bold

**After Left Goal (Red Scores)**:
- Score Display: "0 - 1" ✅
- Update Time: <100ms (instant)

**After Right Goal (Blue Scores)**:
- Score Display: "1 - 1" ✅
- Update Time: <100ms (instant)

**Ball Reset Behavior**:
- ✅ Ball resets to center after 1-second delay
- ✅ `goalScored` flag prevents multiple triggers
- ✅ Console log: "⚽ Goal! [team] scores. Score: X-Y"

**Code Reference**: `GameScene.ts:382-404` (onGoalScored method)

---

### 3. Match Timer ✅ PASS

**Test Method**: Observed timer countdown and tested warning states

**Initial State**:
- Display: "2:00" (120 seconds)
- Format: MM:SS with leading zeros
- Color: White (#ffffff)
- Position: Below score display (x: 400, y: 70)

**Countdown Behavior**:
- ✅ Updates every 1 second (Phaser.Time.TimerEvent)
- ✅ Format maintained: 1:57, 1:30, 0:59, 0:00
- ✅ No skipped seconds or timing drift observed

**Warning State (< 30 seconds)**:
- ✅ Color changes to red (#ff4444) at 0:30
- ✅ Red color maintained until 0:00
- ✅ Test captured: 0:23 showing red color

**Match End Trigger**:
- ✅ Timer reaches 0:00 → `onMatchEnd()` called
- ✅ Timer stops at 0:00 (no negative values)

**Code Reference**:
- Timer setup: `GameScene.ts:426-432`
- Timer update: `GameScene.ts:434-454`

---

### 4. Ball Possession Indicator ✅ PASS

**Test Method**: Moved player within and outside possession radius, observed indicator visibility

**Visual Specifications**:
- Shape: Circle, 40px radius
- Color: Yellow (#ffff00)
- Fill: Transparent (alpha: 0)
- Stroke: 3px, yellow, alpha: 0.6
- Depth: 999 (above field, below UI)

**Possession Detection**:
- **Radius**: 30px (GAME_CONFIG.POSSESSION_RADIUS)
- **Test Case 1**: Player 20px from ball
  - ✅ Indicator visible (alpha: 0.6)
  - ✅ Positioned exactly at player location
  - ✅ Yellow glow clearly visible in screenshot
- **Test Case 2**: Player >30px from ball
  - ✅ Indicator invisible (alpha: 0)
  - ✅ No visual artifacts

**Update Performance**:
- ✅ Updates every frame (60 FPS)
- ✅ Distance calculation: `Math.sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy)`
- ✅ No performance impact observed

**Code Reference**:
- Creation: `GameScene.ts:143-146`
- Update logic: `GameScene.ts:233-243`

---

### 5. Match End Screen ✅ PASS

**Test Method**: Fast-forwarded timer to 0:00 and observed match end behavior

**End Screen Elements**:
- ✅ Dark overlay (70% opacity black, depth: 2000)
- ✅ Result text: "Match Draw!" (white, 48px, bold, centered)
- ✅ Final score: "1 - 1" displayed on field
- ✅ Instruction text: "Tap to restart" (white, centered)

**Winner Detection Logic**:
```
scoreBlue > scoreRed → "Blue Team Wins!"
scoreRed > scoreBlue → "Red Team Wins!"
scoreBlue === scoreRed → "Match Draw!"
```

**Test Results**:
- Score 1-1 → ✅ "Match Draw!" displayed correctly
- All text elements visible and properly positioned
- Overlay fully covers gameplay area

**Restart Functionality**:
- ✅ `scene.restart()` called successfully
- ✅ Score resets: 1-1 → 0-0
- ✅ Timer resets: 0:00 → 2:00
- ✅ Ball and player return to start positions
- ✅ Match end overlay removed completely

**Code Reference**: `GameScene.ts:456-490` (match end methods)

## Bug Found & Fixed

### Issue: Ball Boundary Collision Preventing Goal Detection

**Description**:
Ball was bouncing off field boundaries at margin=20px, preventing it from reaching goal zones at x:10 (left) and x:width-10 (right).

**Root Cause**:
Boundary collision check used simple `if (ball.x <= margin)` logic, which applied to ALL ball positions regardless of Y coordinate.

**Fix Applied** (`GameScene.ts:325-342`):
```typescript
// Before (buggy):
if (this.ball.x <= margin || this.ball.x >= this.scale.width - margin) {
  this.ballVelocity.x *= -0.8
  this.ball.x = Phaser.Math.Clamp(this.ball.x, margin, this.scale.width - margin)
}

// After (fixed):
// Left/right boundaries (exclude goal zones)
if (this.ball.x <= margin && (this.ball.y < this.leftGoal.yMin || this.ball.y > this.leftGoal.yMax)) {
  this.ballVelocity.x *= -0.8
  this.ball.x = margin
}
if (this.ball.x >= this.scale.width - margin && (this.ball.y < this.rightGoal.yMin || this.ball.y > this.rightGoal.yMax)) {
  this.ballVelocity.x *= -0.8
  this.ball.x = this.scale.width - margin
}
```

**Impact**: ✅ Goals now detect correctly when ball enters goal zones within Y range

## Performance Observations

### Frame Rate
- **Target**: 60 FPS
- **Observed**: Stable 60 FPS during all tests
- **No frame drops** during goal detection, scoring, or timer updates

- **During Gameplay**: No memory leaks observed
- **After Restart**: Clean scene reset, no lingering objects

### Code Quality
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode: No compiler errors
- ✅ Vite hot reload: Working correctly (with manual refresh for boundary fix)

   - Brief pause/slowdown on goal scored
   - Visual feedback enhances player satisfaction

2. **Sound Effects** (Day 17-18)
   - Ball kick sound (with power variation)
   - Goal celebration sound
   - Match start/end whistle
   - Timer warning sound at 0:30

### Medium Priority
3. **Enhanced Possession Indicator**
   - Add pulse animation for extra visual feedback
   - Scale animation when player gets possession
   - Smooth fade in/out transitions

4. **Goal Zone Visualization**
   - Add visual goal zones (colored rectangles/nets)
   - Make goals more obvious to players
   - Improve game feel and clarity

### Low Priority
5. **UI Polish**
   - Add team names/colors to score display
   - Animate score changes (scale up, then back)
   - Add match progress indicator
