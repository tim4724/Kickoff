## Test Suite 2: Network Synchronization (multiplayer-network-sync.spec.ts)

### Test Results: ‚ùå 6/6 FAILING

#### Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Issue**: `beforeAll` hook fails to establish connections
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'x')
Session IDs: undefined, undefined
```

**Evidence**:
- Clients load successfully (Phaser initializes)
- Testing API exposed correctly (`window.__gameControls`)
- Network connection attempt fails silently
- `mySessionId` never populated

**Technical Details**:
```javascript
// Line 185-190 in test file
client1SessionId = await client1.evaluate(() => {
  return (window as any).__gameControls?.scene?.mySessionId
})
// Returns: undefined

// Expected: session ID string like "nARAd3DJH"
```

**Why This Happens**:
1. Test loads page: ‚úÖ
2. Phaser initializes: ‚úÖ
3. NetworkManager attempts connection: ‚úÖ
4. Connection timing: ‚ùå 3-second timeout insufficient for WebSocket handshake
5. `mySessionId` never set: ‚ùå

**Server Logs Evidence**:
```
‚úÖ Match room created: 0PW_KDtd5
‚úÖ Player joined: nARAd3DJH (team red)
‚úÖ Player joined: k3yOOHEGN (team blue)
```
Server receives connections but clients don't store session ID fast enough.

#### Failed Tests Summary

All 6 tests fail with same root cause (null sessionId):

1. ‚ùå **Server-Authoritative Player Movement**
   - Expected: Server processes movement inputs
   - Actual: Cannot get player state (sessionId null)

2. ‚ùå **Cross-Client Position Synchronization**
   - Expected: Both clients see same player positions
   - Actual: Cannot query server state (sessionId null)

3. ‚ùå **Ball Possession Detection**
   - Expected: Server detects player near ball
   - Actual: Cannot get ball state (sessionId null)

4. ‚ùå **Ball Magnetism (Stick to Player)**
   - Expected: Ball follows player when stationary
   - Actual: Cannot verify ball position (sessionId null)

5. ‚ùå **Ball Shooting Synchronization**
   - Expected: Shoot action moves ball across clients
   - Actual: Cannot verify ball movement (sessionId null)

6. ‚ùå **Network Resilience Test**
   - Expected: Rapid input changes handled correctly
   - Actual: Cannot verify position changes (sessionId null)

## Code Changes Made

### 1. Test Input Method Updates (tests/multiplayer-network-sync.spec.ts)

**Before** (Direct NetworkManager calls):
```typescript
scene.networkManager.sendInput({ x, y }, false)
```

**After** (Joystick simulation):
```typescript
controls.test.touchJoystick(0, 0)
controls.test.dragJoystick(x * 50, y * 50)
// ... hold duration ...
controls.test.releaseJoystick()
```

**Rationale**: Simulates real user input through game's input system instead of bypassing it.

### 2. Action Button Updates

**Before**:
```typescript
scene.networkManager.sendInput({ x: 0, y: 0 }, true)
```

**After**:
```typescript
controls.test.pressButton()
// ... wait ...
controls.test.releaseButton(holdDuration)
```

**Rationale**: Triggers proper game event handling including power calculation.

### 3. Input Throttling (client/src/scenes/GameScene.ts:344-360)

**Added**:
```typescript
// Only send inputs at 6Hz (166ms) instead of 60fps
// Only send if there's actual movement to avoid zero-spam
const hasMovement = Math.abs(this.playerVelocity.x) > 0.01 ||
                   Math.abs(this.playerVelocity.y) > 0.01

if (hasMovement) {
  const now = Date.now()
  if (now - this.lastInputSentTime >= this.INPUT_SEND_INTERVAL) {
    this.networkManager.sendInput(movement, false)
    this.lastInputSentTime = now
  }
}
```

**Impact**: Prevents zero-input spam flooding the network buffer.

### 4. Buffer Size Reduction (client/src/network/NetworkManager.ts:58)

**Before**: `MAX_BUFFER_SIZE = 10`
**After**: `MAX_BUFFER_SIZE = 3`

**Impact**: Faster input propagation to server (flush after 3 inputs instead of 10).

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### 1. Playwright Keyboard Limitations ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Issue**: Phaser doesn't always receive Playwright keyboard events
- **Impact**: Movement testing unreliable in headless mode
- **Workaround**: Use programmatic movement or joystick simulation
- **Severity**: MEDIUM

### 2. Connection Timing in Test Fixtures ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Issue**: `beforeAll` 3s timeout insufficient for WebSocket handshake
- **Impact**: Network sync tests fail to initialize
- **Fix Required**: Increase timeout to 5-8s or add retry logic
- **Severity**: HIGH

### 3. Server Logs Show Zero Inputs üîç
- **Issue**: Server receives `{ movement: { x: 0, y: 0 } }` even when test sends non-zero
- **Evidence**: Server log line 64 in /tmp/server.log
- **Root Cause**: Game loop still sends zeros despite throttling logic
- **Status**: Under investigation
- **Severity**: HIGH

### 4. Remote Player Visibility ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Issue**: Client 2 sometimes doesn't see Client 1's remote player sprite
- **Impact**: Cross-client validation incomplete
- **Root Cause**: Race condition in player join/render timing
- **Severity**: MEDIUM

## Server Behavior Analysis

### Connection Flow (from server logs)

```
Match room created: 0PW_KDtd5
‚úÖ Match room initialized

Player joined: nARAd3DJH
Added player nARAd3DJH to team red
üéÆ Match starting!

Player joined: k3yOOHEGN
Added player k3yOOHEGN to team blue

[MatchRoom] Update tick #480, dt: 0.033s, phase: playing
üì• [MatchRoom] Input received from nARAd3DJH:
   { movement: { x: 0, y: 0 }, action: true, timestamp: 1759323925244n }
```

**Observations**:
- ‚úÖ Room creation: WORKING
- ‚úÖ Player assignment: WORKING
- ‚úÖ Team balancing: WORKING (first player red, second player blue)
- ‚úÖ Match start trigger: WORKING (starts when 2 players join)
- ‚úÖ Input reception: WORKING (server receives inputs)
- ‚ùå Movement inputs: All zeros received (issue with client-side input capture)

### Server Performance

- **Tick Rate**: 30Hz (0.033-0.037s per tick) ‚úì
- **Phase Management**: Correctly transitions waiting ‚Üí playing ‚úì
- **Connection Handling**: Cleanly disposes rooms when players leave ‚úì
- **Input Processing**: Receives inputs but movement values are zeros ‚ùå

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority: HIGH)

1. **Fix Network Sync Test Fixture**
   ```typescript
   // Update beforeAll in multiplayer-network-sync.spec.ts
   await client1.waitForTimeout(5000) // Increase from 3000

   // Add retry logic
   for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
     client1SessionId = await client1.evaluate(...)
     if (client1SessionId) break
     await client1.waitForTimeout(1000)
   }
   ```

2. **Investigate Zero Input Issue**
   - Add client-side logging to `updatePlayerMovement()`
   - Verify joystick test API actually updates `playerVelocity`
   - Check if zero-prevention logic is too aggressive

3. **Add Connection Health Checks**
   ```typescript
   async function waitForConnection(page, timeout = 8000) {
     const connected = await page.waitForFunction(
       () => (window as any).__gameControls?.scene?.networkManager?.isConnected(),
       { timeout }
     )
     return connected
   }
   ```

### Short-term Improvements (Priority: MEDIUM)
