## Development Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Both client + server
npm run dev:client       # Client only (port 5173)
npm run dev:server       # Server only (port 3000)

# Testing
npx playwright test                    # Run all E2E tests
npx playwright test --ui              # Interactive test UI
npx playwright test tests/lag-measurement.spec.ts  # Lag test

# Building
npm run build           # Build for production
```

## Performance
