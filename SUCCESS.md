# ✅ Socca2 is Running!

## 🎉 Success - Both Servers Running

Your game foundation is live and ready for development!

### 🌐 Access Points

- **Client (Game):** http://localhost:5173
- **Server (API):** http://localhost:3000
- **Monitor Dashboard:** http://localhost:3000/colyseus

---

## 🎮 Try It Now!

1. **Open the game:** http://localhost:5173
2. **Move your player:** Arrow Keys
3. **Shoot the ball:** Space Bar

You'll see:
- Green soccer field with goals
- Blue player (controlled by you)
- White ball in center
- Score display (0-0) at top

---

## ✅ What's Working

### Client Features
- ✅ Phaser game engine running
- ✅ Soccer field rendering (green field, goals, boundaries)
- ✅ Player movement (keyboard controls)
- ✅ Ball physics (bouncing, friction)
- ✅ Shooting mechanic (get close + space bar)
- ✅ Ball magnetism (sticks to player when close)
- ✅ UI elements (score, timer, controls hint)

### Server Features
- ✅ Colyseus multiplayer server
- ✅ Match room system ready
- ✅ Game state management
- ✅ Physics simulation (30 Hz)
- ✅ Goal detection logic
- ✅ Player management (2 human players supported)

---

## 📝 Quick Implementation Notes

### Module Resolution Fix

**Issue:** Node.js ES modules couldn't resolve TypeScript path aliases

**Solution:** Embedded shared types directly into server files for now
- `server/src/schema/GameState.ts` - Has GAME_CONFIG, types
- `server/src/rooms/MatchRoom.ts` - Has minimal GAME_CONFIG

**Future:** Will use proper shared package once build setup is optimized

### Colyseus Import Fix

**Issue:** Colyseus uses default exports in ES modules

**Solution:** Changed from named imports to default import
```typescript
// Before
import { Server, Room } from 'colyseus'

// After
import Colyseus from 'colyseus'
const { Server, Room } = Colyseus
```

## 🚀 Current Progress

**Week 1-2 Roadmap Status:** Days 1-4 Complete ✅

- [x] Project scaffolding
- [x] Client setup (Vite + TypeScript + Phaser)
- [x] Server setup (Node.js + Colyseus)
- [x] Basic rendering (field + player + ball)
- [x] Keyboard controls
- [x] Ball physics
- [ ] Virtual joystick (mobile touch controls) → **Next task**
- [ ] Mobile testing
- [ ] Movement animations

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (Week 1-2 remaining)

1. **Virtual Joystick** (Days 5-7)
   - Add touch controls for mobile
   - Position in bottom-left corner
   - Test on actual mobile device

2. **Action Button** (Days 5-7)
   - Touch button for pass/shoot
   - Position in bottom-right corner
   - Hold for power shot

3. **Polish** (Days 8-10)
   - Player animations
   - Camera smoothing
   - 60 FPS optimization

### Week 3-4: Ball Mechanics & Goals

- Pass/shoot mechanics refinement
- Goal scoring with celebrations
- Match timer and end-game flow

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Minor
- Deprecation warning from Colyseus about `pingInterval` (cosmetic, doesn't affect functionality)
- Shared types duplicated in server files (will refactor once build optimized)

### None Critical
- Everything working as expected for MVP Week 1-2 milestone

---

##  🎮 Controls Reference

**Current (Desktop Testing):**
- **↑↓←→** - Move player
- **Space** - Shoot/Pass ball

**Planned (Mobile):**
- Virtual joystick (left thumb) - Movement
- Action button (right thumb) - Shoot/Pass

---

## 📊 Server Status

Check server health: http://localhost:3000/health

Returns:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": 1727771732364,
  "rooms": { /* active rooms stats */ }
}
```

---

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Making Changes

**Client changes:**
1. Edit files in `client/src/`
2. Vite auto-reloads in browser
3. Check browser console for errors

**Server changes:**
1. Edit files in `server/src/`
2. tsx auto-restarts server
3. Check terminal for errors

### Stopping Servers

```bash
# In terminal where npm run dev is running:
Ctrl+C

# Or kill ports manually:
npx kill-port 3000 5173
```

### Restarting

```bash
npm run dev
```
