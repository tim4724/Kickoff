### Tasks

#### Day 36-38: AI Foundation
- [ ] Create AIController class
  ```typescript
  class AIController {
    update(player: Player, state: GameState): PlayerInput {
      // Determine behavior
      const behavior = this.selectBehavior(player, state)

      // Generate input based on behavior
      switch (behavior) {
        case 'chase_ball':
          return this.chaseBall(player, state.ball)
        case 'defend':
          return this.defend(player, state)
        case 'support':
          return this.support(player, state)
      }
    }

    chaseBall(player: Player, ball: Ball): PlayerInput {
      const dx = ball.x - player.x
      const dy = ball.y - player.y
      const dist = Math.sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy)

      return {
        movement: { x: dx/dist, y: dy/dist },
        action: dist < 40, // Kick if close
        timestamp: Date.now()
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- [ ] Add 4 AI players per team to GameState
  ```typescript
  onCreate() {
    // Team Blue
    this.state.players.set('blue_human', new Player({ team: 'blue', isHuman: true }))
    this.state.players.set('blue_ai_1', new Player({ team: 'blue', isHuman: false }))
    this.state.players.set('blue_ai_2', new Player({ team: 'blue', isHuman: false }))
    // ... etc for 4 AI + 1 human per team
  }
  ```
- [ ] AI chases ball behavior (simplest)
- [ ] Test: AI bots all run toward ball

#### Day 39-41: AI Positioning
- [ ] Implement formation system (4-4-2 simple formation)
  ```typescript
  getFormationPosition(player: Player, state: GameState): {x, y} {
    // Assign positions based on role
    const formations = {
      'blue_ai_1': { x: 200, y: 200 }, // Defender
      'blue_ai_2': { x: 200, y: 400 }, // Defender
      'blue_ai_3': { x: 400, y: 300 }, // Midfielder
      'blue_ai_4': { x: 600, y: 300 }, // Forward
    }
    return formations[player.id]
  }
  ```
- [ ] AI holds formation when ball is far
- [ ] AI pushes forward when ball in enemy half
- [ ] AI drops back when defending
- [ ] Test: Bots maintain reasonable spacing

#### Day 42-44: Cursor Switching
- [ ] Implement nearest-to-ball logic
  ```typescript
  updateControlledPlayers(state: GameState) {
    // For each human player
    state.players.forEach((player) => {
      if (player.isHuman) {
        // Find their AI teammates
        const teammates = this.getAITeammates(player.team, state)

        // Find nearest to ball
        let nearest = teammates[0]
        let minDist = distance(nearest, state.ball)

        teammates.forEach((teammate) => {
          const dist = distance(teammate, state.ball)
          if (dist < minDist) {
            nearest = teammate
            minDist = dist
          }
        })

        // Update control flags
        teammates.forEach((t) => {
          t.isControlled = (t.id === nearest.id)
        })
      }
    })
  }
  ```
- [ ] Add isControlled flag to Player schema
- [ ] Server updates control flags every tick
- [ ] Client receives control updates
- [ ] Client input applies to controlled player only
  ```typescript
  sendInput(input: PlayerInput) {
    // Find which player is currently controlled
    const controlled = this.getControlledPlayer()
    networkManager.sendInput({ playerId: controlled.id, input })
  }
  ```

#### Day 45-47: Visual Feedback
- [ ] Highlight controlled player (pulsing circle, glow effect)
  ```typescript
  updatePlayerSprites() {
    this.state.players.forEach((player, id) => {
      const sprite = this.playerSprites.get(id)

      if (player.isControlled) {
        // Add highlight
        sprite.setTint(0xffff00)
        this.add.circle(sprite.x, sprite.y, 40, 0xffff00, 0.3) // Glow
      } else {
        sprite.clearTint()
      }
    })
  }
  ```
- [ ] Arrow above controlled player head
- [ ] Smooth camera follow controlled player (with damping)
- [ ] Brief flash/haptic feedback on switch
- [ ] Add 200ms cooldown (prevent rapid switching)

#### Day 48-49: AI Actions
- [ ] AI can pass to open teammates
  ```typescript
  aiDecideAction(player: Player, state: GameState): 'pass' | 'shoot' | null {
    if (!this.hasBall(player, state.ball)) return null

    const distToGoal = this.distanceToEnemyGoal(player)

    if (distToGoal < 150) {
      return 'shoot'
    }

    // Find open teammate
    const openTeammate = this.findOpenTeammate(player, state)
    if (openTeammate) {
      return 'pass'
    }

    return null
  }
  ```
- [ ] AI shoots when near goal
- [ ] AI decision-making runs every 0.5s (not every tick)
- [ ] Test: AI completes simple passes and shoots on goal

### Deliverable
⚽ **Complete 5v5 gameplay:** 1 human + 4 AI bots vs 1 human + 4 AI bots, cursor switching works smoothly

### Risks
- AI feels dumb or frustrating → Playtesting critical, iterate on behaviors
- Cursor switching confusing → Strong visual feedback, consider brief tutorial
- AI pathfinding complex → Keep it simple (direct movement toward target)

- [ ] Create service worker (for offline assets)
  ```javascript
  // client/public/sw.js
  self.addEventListener('install', (event) => {
    event.waitUntil(
      caches.open('socca2-v1').then((cache) => {
        return cache.addAll([
          '/',
          '/assets/sprites.png',
          '/assets/sounds.mp3',
          // ... all assets
        ])
      })
    )
  })
  ```
- [ ] Register service worker in app
- [ ] Test "Add to Home Screen" on iOS and Android
- [ ] Verify offline asset loading (game loads, shows "no connection" for multiplayer)

#### Day 65-67: Deployment
- [ ] Set up hosting (Railway/Render)
  - Create account, link GitHub repo
  - Configure build commands:
    ```bash
    # Client
    cd client && npm install && npm run build

    # Server
    cd server && npm install && npm run build
    ```
  - Set environment variables (DATABASE_URL if using DB)
- [ ] Configure custom domain (optional)
  ```
  socca2.yourdomain.com → Render app
  ```
- [ ] Set up HTTPS (required for PWA, WebSocket)
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Smoke test production deployment
  - Can I join a match?
  - Does gameplay work smoothly?
  - Do assets load correctly?

#### Day 68-70: Launch Prep
- [ ] Create landing page (optional but recommended)
  - Game description
  - Screenshot/GIF of gameplay
  - "Play Now" button → PWA link
- [ ] Set up analytics (Plausible or Mixpanel)
  - Track: Players joined, matches completed, session length
- [ ] Prepare social media posts (Twitter, Reddit)
  - "I just shipped Socca2, a fast-paced multiplayer soccer game!"
  - Include gameplay video (record 30s clip)
- [ ] Soft launch to friends/beta testers
  - Gather final feedback
  - Monitor for critical bugs
- [ ] **PUBLIC LAUNCH** 🚀

### Deliverable
🚀 **Production-ready MVP:** Deployed, playable, polished game accessible to anyone with a mobile browser

### Risks
- Deployment issues → Test staging environment first
- Last-minute bugs → Freeze features 3 days before launch, bug fixes only
- Poor performance in production → Load test with 20+ concurrent users before launch

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation Plan

### High-Risk Items

**1. AI Feels Bad**
- **Mitigation:** Allocate full week 7-8 for AI tuning
- **Playtest frequently** (every 2 days during week 7-8)
- **Reference existing games** (FIFA, Rocket League AI patterns)
- **Fallback:** Simplify to 3v3 if 5v5 AI too complex

**2. Network Lag Ruins Gameplay**
- **Mitigation:** Test on real mobile networks (not just WiFi)
- **Target 20 Hz minimum** tick rate (not 30 Hz if bandwidth limited)
- **Implement lag compensation** (client-side prediction + interpolation)
- **Fallback:** Add "Network Quality" indicator, warn players

**3. Scope Creep**
- **Mitigation:** **Strict feature freeze** after week 8
- **No new features** during week 9-10 (polish only)
- **Defer to Phase 2** any non-critical requests
- **Fallback:** Cut power-ups, advanced AI if behind schedule

**4. Deployment Issues**
- **Mitigation:** Deploy to staging environment by week 8
- **Test production-like setup** early (HTTPS, WebSocket, CDN)
- **Document deployment steps** (checklist)
- **Fallback:** Use Heroku/Railway free tier for initial launch

2. Check official docs (Phaser, Colyseus)
3. Ask in Discord communities (Phaser, Colyseus servers)
4. Simplify the problem (reduce scope if needed)
5. Take a break (walk, coffee, come back fresh)

### Stay Motivated
- **Celebrate small wins:** Shipped player movement? Celebrate!
- **Share progress:** Tweet/post demos weekly
- **Visualize the goal:** Imagine launch day excitement
- **Find accountability partner:** Daily check-ins with friend
