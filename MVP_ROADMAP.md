## Week 5-6: Multiplayer Networking
**Status**: ⏳ **IN PROGRESS** (Phase 1 Complete)

### Goals
✓ Colyseus server running
✓ Two players can connect and see each other
⏳ Real-time state synchronization working
⏳ Client-side prediction implemented

### Tasks

#### Day 22-24: Colyseus Server Setup ✅
- [x] Create basic Colyseus server
  ```typescript
  // server/src/index.ts
  import { Server } from 'colyseus'
  import { createServer } from 'http'
  import express from 'express'

  const app = express()
  const gameServer = new Server({ server: createServer(app) })

  gameServer.define('match', MatchRoom)

  gameServer.listen(3000)
  ```
- [x] Define GameState schema
  ```typescript
  // server/src/schema/GameState.ts
  import { Schema, type, MapSchema } from '@colyseus/schema'

  class Player extends Schema {
    @type('string') id: string
    @type('number') x: number = 400
    @type('number') y: number = 300
    @type('number') velocityX: number = 0
    @type('number') velocityY: number = 0
  }

  class Ball extends Schema {
    @type('number') x: number = 400
    @type('number') y: number = 300
    @type('number') velocityX: number = 0
    @type('number') velocityY: number = 0
  }

  class GameState extends Schema {
    @type({ map: Player }) players = new MapSchema<Player>()
    @type(Ball) ball = new Ball()
  }
  ```
- [x] Create MatchRoom class
  ```typescript
  class MatchRoom extends Room<GameState> {
    onCreate() {
      this.setState(new GameState())
      this.setSimulationInterval(() => this.update(), 1000 / 30) // 30 Hz
    }

    onJoin(client: Client) {
      const player = new Player()
      player.id = client.sessionId
      this.state.players.set(client.sessionId, player)
    }

    update() {
      // Game loop runs here
    }
  }
  ```
- [x] Test server locally (http://localhost:3000)

#### Day 25-27: Client-Server Connection ✅
- [x] Install Colyseus client SDK
  ```bash
  cd client
  npm install colyseus.js
  ```
- [x] Connect to server from Phaser game
  ```typescript
  // client/src/network/NetworkManager.ts
  import { Client, Room } from 'colyseus.js'

  class NetworkManager {
    client: Client
    room: Room<GameState>

    async connect() {
      this.client = new Client('ws://localhost:3000')
      this.room = await this.client.joinOrCreate<GameState>('match')

      this.room.onStateChange((state) => {
        console.log('State update:', state)
      })
    }

    sendInput(input: PlayerInput) {
      this.room.send('input', input)
    }
  }
  ```
- [x] Display connected players on screen (debug text)
- [x] Send input from client to server
- [x] Verify server receives input (console.log)

**Phase 1 Complete!** ✅ (2025-10-01)
- Server foundation established with Colyseus
- NetworkManager created (307 lines)
- Server-client connection verified with 100% test pass rate
- Schema aligned with Week 3-4 client implementation
- See: `WEEK5-6_PHASE1_COMPLETE.md` for full details

#### Day 28-30: State Synchronization
- [ ] Server processes player input
  ```typescript
  // In MatchRoom
  onMessage(client: Client, type: string, message: any) {
    if (type === 'input') {
      const player = this.state.players.get(client.sessionId)
      player.velocityX = message.movement.x * 200
      player.velocityY = message.movement.y * 200
    }
  }

  update() {
    // Update all player positions
    this.state.players.forEach((player) => {
      player.x += player.velocityX * (1 / 30) // 30 Hz tick
      player.y += player.velocityY * (1 / 30)
    })
  }
  ```
- [ ] Client renders other players from server state
  ```typescript
  room.state.players.onAdd = (player, sessionId) => {
    // Create sprite for new player
    const sprite = this.add.sprite(player.x, player.y, 'player')
    this.playerSprites.set(sessionId, sprite)
  }

  room.state.players.onChange = (player, sessionId) => {
    // Update sprite position
    const sprite = this.playerSprites.get(sessionId)
    sprite.x = player.x
    sprite.y = player.y
  }
  ```
- [ ] Test with two browser windows (Player 1 and Player 2)
- [ ] Verify both players see each other moving

#### Day 31-33: Client-Side Prediction
- [ ] Implement prediction for local player
  ```typescript
  class ClientPrediction {
    serverState: GameState
    predictedState: GameState
    inputBuffer: PlayerInput[] = []

    applyInput(input: PlayerInput) {
      // 1. Apply to predicted state immediately
      this.predictedState.myPlayer.x += input.movement.x * 200 * dt

      // 2. Send to server
      networkManager.sendInput(input)

      // 3. Buffer for reconciliation
      this.inputBuffer.push(input)
    }

    onServerUpdate(state: GameState, lastProcessedInputId: number) {
      this.serverState = state

      // Remove confirmed inputs
      this.inputBuffer = this.inputBuffer.filter(
        input => input.id > lastProcessedInputId
      )

      // Replay unconfirmed inputs
      this.predictedState = state.clone()
      this.inputBuffer.forEach(input => {
        this.predictedState.applyInput(input)
      })
    }

    getDisplayState() {
      // Render local player at predicted position, others at server position
      return {
        myPlayer: this.predictedState.myPlayer,
        otherPlayers: this.serverState.players
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- [ ] Add input sequence IDs (for reconciliation)
- [ ] Test: Local player feels instant, remote player has slight delay (expected)

#### Day 34-35: Ball Synchronization
- [ ] Move ball physics to server
- [ ] Client sends shoot/pass actions (not ball velocity)
  ```typescript
  // Client
  onActionButton() {
    networkManager.sendAction({ type: 'shoot', power: 0.8 })
  }

  // Server
  onMessage(client, type, message) {
    if (type === 'action' && message.type === 'shoot') {
      this.shootBall(client.sessionId, message.power)
    }
  }
  ```
- [ ] Client renders ball at server-authoritative position
- [ ] Add ball interpolation (smooth motion between updates)
- [ ] Test: Ball movement synced across both clients

### Deliverable
🌐 **Working multiplayer:** Two players can move, shoot, and score goals in real-time match

### Risks
- Network lag noticeable → Implement interpolation for remote entities
- Prediction mispredictions → Tune reconciliation algorithm
- Colyseus learning curve → Use official examples as reference

---

## Week 7-8: AI Teammates & Cursor Switching

### Goals
✓ 4 AI bots per team (10 total players)
✓ AI bots have basic positioning and movement
✓ Cursor switching works (auto-switch to nearest player to ball)
✓ AI can pass and shoot

### Tasks

#### Day 36-38: AI Foundation
- [ ] Create AIController class
  ```typescript
  class AIController {
    update(player: Player, state: GameState): PlayerInput {
      // Determine behavior
      const behavior = this.selectBehavior(player, state)

      // Generate input based on behavior
      switch (behavior) {
        case 'chase_ball':
          return this.chaseBall(player, state.ball)
        case 'defend':
          return this.defend(player, state)
        case 'support':
          return this.support(player, state)
      }
    }

    chaseBall(player: Player, ball: Ball): PlayerInput {
      const dx = ball.x - player.x
      const dy = ball.y - player.y
      const dist = Math.sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy)

      return {
        movement: { x: dx/dist, y: dy/dist },
        action: dist < 40, // Kick if close
        timestamp: Date.now()
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- [ ] Add 4 AI players per team to GameState
  ```typescript
  onCreate() {
    // Team Blue
    this.state.players.set('blue_human', new Player({ team: 'blue', isHuman: true }))
    this.state.players.set('blue_ai_1', new Player({ team: 'blue', isHuman: false }))
    this.state.players.set('blue_ai_2', new Player({ team: 'blue', isHuman: false }))
    // ... etc for 4 AI + 1 human per team
  }
  ```
- [ ] AI chases ball behavior (simplest)
- [ ] Test: AI bots all run toward ball

#### Day 39-41: AI Positioning
- [ ] Implement formation system (4-4-2 simple formation)
  ```typescript
  getFormationPosition(player: Player, state: GameState): {x, y} {
    // Assign positions based on role
    const formations = {
      'blue_ai_1': { x: 200, y: 200 }, // Defender
      'blue_ai_2': { x: 200, y: 400 }, // Defender
      'blue_ai_3': { x: 400, y: 300 }, // Midfielder
      'blue_ai_4': { x: 600, y: 300 }, // Forward
    }
    return formations[player.id]
  }
  ```
- [ ] AI holds formation when ball is far
- [ ] AI pushes forward when ball in enemy half
- [ ] AI drops back when defending
- [ ] Test: Bots maintain reasonable spacing

#### Day 42-44: Cursor Switching
- [ ] Implement nearest-to-ball logic
  ```typescript
  updateControlledPlayers(state: GameState) {
    // For each human player
    state.players.forEach((player) => {
      if (player.isHuman) {
        // Find their AI teammates
        const teammates = this.getAITeammates(player.team, state)

        // Find nearest to ball
        let nearest = teammates[0]
        let minDist = distance(nearest, state.ball)

        teammates.forEach((teammate) => {
          const dist = distance(teammate, state.ball)
          if (dist < minDist) {
            nearest = teammate
            minDist = dist
          }
        })

        // Update control flags
        teammates.forEach((t) => {
          t.isControlled = (t.id === nearest.id)
        })
      }
    })
  }
  ```
- [ ] Add isControlled flag to Player schema
- [ ] Server updates control flags every tick
- [ ] Client receives control updates
- [ ] Client input applies to controlled player only
  ```typescript
  sendInput(input: PlayerInput) {
    // Find which player is currently controlled
    const controlled = this.getControlledPlayer()
    networkManager.sendInput({ playerId: controlled.id, input })
  }
  ```

#### Day 45-47: Visual Feedback
- [ ] Highlight controlled player (pulsing circle, glow effect)
  ```typescript
  updatePlayerSprites() {
    this.state.players.forEach((player, id) => {
      const sprite = this.playerSprites.get(id)

      if (player.isControlled) {
        // Add highlight
        sprite.setTint(0xffff00)
        this.add.circle(sprite.x, sprite.y, 40, 0xffff00, 0.3) // Glow
      } else {
        sprite.clearTint()
      }
    })
  }
  ```
- [ ] Arrow above controlled player head
- [ ] Smooth camera follow controlled player (with damping)
- [ ] Brief flash/haptic feedback on switch
- [ ] Add 200ms cooldown (prevent rapid switching)

#### Day 48-49: AI Actions
- [ ] AI can pass to open teammates
  ```typescript
  aiDecideAction(player: Player, state: GameState): 'pass' | 'shoot' | null {
    if (!this.hasBall(player, state.ball)) return null

    const distToGoal = this.distanceToEnemyGoal(player)

    if (distToGoal < 150) {
      return 'shoot'
    }

    // Find open teammate
    const openTeammate = this.findOpenTeammate(player, state)
    if (openTeammate) {
      return 'pass'
    }

    return null
  }
  ```
- [ ] AI shoots when near goal
- [ ] AI decision-making runs every 0.5s (not every tick)
- [ ] Test: AI completes simple passes and shoots on goal

### Deliverable
⚽ **Complete 5v5 gameplay:** 1 human + 4 AI bots vs 1 human + 4 AI bots, cursor switching works smoothly

### Risks
- AI feels dumb or frustrating → Playtesting critical, iterate on behaviors
- Cursor switching confusing → Strong visual feedback, consider brief tutorial
- AI pathfinding complex → Keep it simple (direct movement toward target)

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation Plan

### High-Risk Items

**1. AI Feels Bad**
- **Mitigation:** Allocate full week 7-8 for AI tuning
- **Playtest frequently** (every 2 days during week 7-8)
- **Reference existing games** (FIFA, Rocket League AI patterns)
- **Fallback:** Simplify to 3v3 if 5v5 AI too complex

**2. Network Lag Ruins Gameplay**
- **Mitigation:** Test on real mobile networks (not just WiFi)
- **Target 20 Hz minimum** tick rate (not 30 Hz if bandwidth limited)
- **Implement lag compensation** (client-side prediction + interpolation)
- **Fallback:** Add "Network Quality" indicator, warn players

**3. Scope Creep**
- **Mitigation:** **Strict feature freeze** after week 8
- **No new features** during week 9-10 (polish only)
- **Defer to Phase 2** any non-critical requests
- **Fallback:** Cut power-ups, advanced AI if behind schedule

**4. Deployment Issues**
- **Mitigation:** Deploy to staging environment by week 8
- **Test production-like setup** early (HTTPS, WebSocket, CDN)
- **Document deployment steps** (checklist)
- **Fallback:** Use Heroku/Railway free tier for initial launch
