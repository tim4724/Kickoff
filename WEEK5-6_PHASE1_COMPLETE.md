**Completion Date**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: ✅ **PHASE 1 COMPLETE - Server Foundation & Client Connection**

---

## Executive Summary

Week 5-6 Phase 1 (Server Foundation & Client-Server Connection) is successfully complete. The multiplayer networking infrastructure is established with Colyseus server, NetworkManager client integration, and verified server-client connectivity.

**Phase Duration**: ~2 hours (Days 22-24 workflow estimated 8-10 hours)
**Efficiency**: 4-5x faster than estimated

---

## What Was Accomplished

### ✅ Server Foundation (Days 22-24)

#### 1. Colyseus Dependencies Installed
- **Server**: `colyseus@0.15.57`, `@colyseus/schema@2.0.37`, `@colyseus/monitor@0.15.0`
- **Client**: `colyseus.js@0.15.11`
- **Dev Tools**: `tsx@4.7.0` (server), `tsx@4.20.6` (client)

**Status**: ✅ Complete

#### 2. GameState Schema Aligned with Client
**Location**: `server/src/schema/GameState.ts`

**Changes Made**:
- Added goal zone constants matching client implementation:
  ```typescript
  GOAL_WIDTH: 20
  GOAL_Y_MIN: 200
  GOAL_Y_MAX: 400
  ```
- Changed match timer to countdown (was counting up):
  ```typescript
  @type('number') matchTime: number = GAME_CONFIG.MATCH_DURATION // 120s
  updateTimer(dt: number) {
    this.matchTime -= dt // Countdown
    if (this.matchTime < 0) this.matchTime = 0
  }
  ```
- Updated goal detection to match client zones:
  ```typescript
  // Left goal: x <= 30 (10 + GOAL_WIDTH)
  // Right goal: x >= 770 (FIELD_WIDTH - 30)
  // Y range: 200-400 (GOAL_Y_MIN to GOAL_Y_MAX)
  ```
- Added `goalScored` flag to prevent duplicate detection
- Added 1-second delay before ball reset after goals

**Status**: ✅ Complete

#### 3. MatchRoom Updated for Countdown Timer
**Location**: `server/src/rooms/MatchRoom.ts`

**Changes Made**:
- Updated match end condition from `>= MATCH_DURATION` to `<= 0`
- Server now properly handles countdown timer synchronization

**Status**: ✅ Complete

#### 4. Server Running Successfully
- Server starts on `http://localhost:3000`
- Colyseus monitor available at `http://localhost:3000/colyseus`
- Health check endpoint active at `http://localhost:3000/health`

networkManager.on('stateChange', (state) => {
  console.log('Game state updated:', state)
})

networkManager.on('playerJoin', (player) => {
  console.log('Player joined:', player.id, player.team)
